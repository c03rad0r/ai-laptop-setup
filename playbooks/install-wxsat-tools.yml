          - gqrxraw2wav.sh: A script to convert GQRX raw I/Q data to a WAV file.
          - gqrx-sdr: An open source software defined radio receiver (SDR) powered by the GNU Radio and the Qt graphical toolkit.
          - rtl-sdr: A package that provides drivers for Realtek RTL2832U based DVB-T receivers, which can be used as a cheap SDR.
          - gpredict: A real-time satellite tracking and orbit prediction application.
